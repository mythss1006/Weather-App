Excited to share my Weather App Web Application project!

As part of my web development learning journey, I built a weather application that fetches real-time weather data and displays it in a simple and user-friendly interface.
 Key Features: 
• Search weather by city name
• Real-time weather information
• Temperature and weather condition display
• Responsive design
• Clean UI

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Weather API

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/mythss1006/Weather-App

Live Demo: https://mythss1006.github.io/Weather-App/

This project helped me understand API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamic data handling.
I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!
